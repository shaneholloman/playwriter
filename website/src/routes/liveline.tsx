      <P>
        Playwriter lets you control your Chrome browser with the full
        Playwright API. A Chrome extension, a local relay, and a CLI. No new
        browser windows, no Chrome flags, no context bloat.
      </P>

      <ChartPlaceholder height={300} label="demo" />
      <Caption>
        Your existing Chrome session. Extensions, logins, cookies &mdash; all there.
      </Caption>

      <P>
        Every browser automation MCP I tried either spawns a new Chrome
        instance or forces you into a limited set of predefined tools. Playwriter
        does neither. It connects to the browser you already have open,
        exposes the full Playwright API through a single{" "}
        <Code>execute</Code> tool, and gets out of the way.
        One tool. Any Playwright code. No wrappers.
      </P>

      <Section id="getting-started" title="Getting started">

      <P>
        Three steps. Extension, icon click, then you&apos;re automating.
      </P>

      <CodeBlock lang="bash">{`# 1. Install the Chrome extension
#    https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/playwriter-mcp/jfeammnjpkecdekppnclgkkffahnhfhe

# 2. Click the extension icon on a tab — it turns green

# 3. Install CLI and run your first command
npm i -g playwriter
playwriter -s 1 -e "await page.goto('https://example.com')"`}</CodeBlock>

      <P>
        The extension connects your browser to a local WebSocket relay on{" "}
        <Code>localhost:19988</Code>. The CLI sends Playwright
        code through the relay. No remote servers, no accounts, nothing
        leaves your machine.
      </P>

      <CodeBlock lang="bash">{`playwriter session new              # new sandbox, outputs id (e.g. 1)
playwriter -s 1 -e "await page.goto('https://example.com')"
playwriter -s 1 -e "console.log(await snapshot({ page }))"
playwriter -s 1 -e "await page.locator('aria-ref=e5').click()"`}</CodeBlock>

        Extension icon green = connected. Gray = not attached to this tab.
      </Caption>

      </Section>

      <Section id="how-it-works" title="How it works">

      <P>
        The extension uses <Code>chrome.debugger</Code> to
        attach to tabs where you clicked the icon. It opens a WebSocket
        connection to a local relay server. The CLI (or MCP, or your own
        Playwright script) connects to the same relay. CDP commands flow
        through; the extension forwards them to Chrome and sends responses
        back.

      <P>
        No Chrome restart required. No <Code>--remote-debugging-port</Code>{" "}
        flags. The extension handles the CDP attachment transparently, and
        the relay multiplexes sessions so multiple agents or CLI instances
        can work with the same browser simultaneously.

      <Section id="snapshots" title="Accessibility snapshots">

      <P>
        The core feedback loop is <strong>observe &rarr; act &rarr; observe</strong>.
        Accessibility snapshots are the primary way to read page state. They return
        the full interactive element tree as text, with Playwright locators attached
        to every element.

#         - link "Blog" role=link[name="Blog"]`}</CodeBlock>

      <P>
        Each line ends with a locator you can pass directly to{" "}
        <Code>page.locator()</Code>. Subsequent calls return a
        diff, so you only see what changed. Use{" "}
        <Code>search</Code> to filter large pages.
      </P>

      <CodeBlock lang="bash">{`# Search for specific elements

playwriter -s 1 -e "console.log('URL:', page.url()); await snapshot({ page }).then(console.log)"`}</CodeBlock>

      <P>
        Snapshots are text. They cost a fraction of what screenshots cost in
        tokens. Use them as your primary debugging tool. Only reach for
        screenshots when spatial layout matters &mdash; grids, dashboards, maps.

        For pages where spatial layout matters,{" "}

        Labels are color-coded by element type: yellow for links, orange for

        salmon for menus, amber for tabs. The ref system is shared with{" "}

        Edits are in-memory and persist until the page reloads. Useful for
        toggling debug flags, patching broken code, or testing quick fixes

      <P>
        Intercept requests and responses to reverse-engineer APIs, scrape
        data, or debug network issues. Store captured data in{" "}
        <Code>state</Code> and analyze across calls.
      </P>

        This is faster than scrolling through DOM. Capture the real API

      <P>
        Record the active tab as video using{" "}

        Unlike <Code>getDisplayMedia</Code>, this approach
