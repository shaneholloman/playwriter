      <P>
        Every browser automation MCP I tried either spawns a new Chrome
        instance or forces you into a limited set of predefined tools. Playwriter
        does neither. It connects to the browser you already have open,
        exposes the <strong>full Playwright API</strong> through a single{" "}
        <Code>execute</Code> tool, and gets out of the way.
        One tool. Any Playwright code. No wrappers.

        <P>
          The extension uses <Code>chrome.debugger</Code> to

          connection to a local relay server. The CLI (or MCP, or your own
          Playwright script) connects to the same relay. <strong>CDP commands flow
          through</strong>; the extension forwards them to Chrome and sends responses
          back.
